# CeaserCipher
In this program I created “caesar cipher”, is a substitution cipher with a little more security. The cipher
uses a dictionary where each plaintext letter has a corresponding ciphertext letter paired with it.
For example we might say a is substituted with m, b is substituted with x, etc. to encrypt, each
letter is replaced with its ciphertext letter. To decrypt, the reverse process takes place: each
ciphertext letter is replaced with the plaintext letter.
